You are a detective.....

During your winter break, you decided to went on a vacation.
Sadly, fate doesn't allow you to take a break.

You met a group of 7 people and are supposed to solve a
murder case caused by an internal conflict.

What drives them to do so? Only God knows (and the maker of
this game of course). You are only equiped with your
detective brain. So do your best and solve the case.

Au revoir.
